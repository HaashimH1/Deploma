                                liberal arts, law, medicine, and theology.</li>

                                education was only accessible to a privileged elite due to financial, social, and
                                educational barriers, with Latin literacy being a requirement.</li>

                                education beyond religious and legal training.</li>
                            <li>Classrooms evolved with larger windows for better lighting, desks and benches for
                                student comfort, and lecturers incorporating visual aids like maps or anatomical
                                drawings alongside printed books for students to follow along during lectures.</li>
